discontinued. If you're still using a 32-bit OS or a macOS version below 10.13,

https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/changing-ankis-build-system-to-bazel/4737. Python
3.8 is now the minimum supported version, so feel free to go wild with the

<h3 id="changes-in-2135beta1"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2135beta1">Changes in 2.1.35beta1</a></h3>
<p>Build 84dcaa86 / 2020-09-30.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.29+ that caused excessive memory and CPU usage
on long-running operations that show a progress bar, such as importing.</li>
<li>Roll back Mac and Windows builds to Qt 5.14 again,
as there are still issues with 5.15.</li>
<li>Fix display issue in graphs on alternate Mac build.</li>

<h3 id="changes-in-2134beta2"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2134beta2">Changes in 2.1.34beta2</a></h3>
<p>Build 8af8f565 / 2020-09-22.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to
an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck
configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those
deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. If you have deliberately
set an initial ease of 130%, please change it to 131% or greater prior to
upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings alone. Users who updated from
an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not
be affected. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.</li>
<li>Roll back most of the non-bugfix scheduling changes from the previous beta, so
that this can be released as stable after a couple of days of testing.</li>

<ul>
<li>Card generation now supports negated conditionals, and a mix of required

<li>When adding/importing, if a normal note doesn't generate any cards, Anki

<p>Build 394f7c63.</p>
<p>This beta changes the macOS dark mode handling of the standard build:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anki now solely relies on the night mode setting in the preferences to decide
whether to show in light or dark mode. Some users wanted to run Anki in light
mode while keeping the rest of their system dark, and there were various
display problems when dark mode was changed after Anki started that couldn't
be easily worked around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users who only use dark mode, and preferred the native look of widgets in dark
mode, can achieve the previous appearance by running the following command in
the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool no
</code></pre>
<p>And the following in the debug console:</p>
<pre><code>mw.pm.meta[&quot;dark_mode_widgets&quot;] = True
</code></pre>
<p>This is hidden behind a debug console command because it requires the
user ensure their system is always set to the same light/dark mode
as Anki.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The macOS standard build is built with a newer SDK. If you notice any regressions, please let me know.</li>
<li>Fixed Anki closing after a full sync on collection load.</li>
<li>Fixed an error being shown when replaying audio.</li>

<h3 id="changes-in-2124beta1"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2124beta1">Changes in 2.1.24beta1</a></h3>
<p>Build 9dda5cf6.</p>
<p>2.1.24 focuses on changes to the database layer and searching code.</p>
<p>Searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now use <code>re:something</code> to search via regular expression, eg:
<ul>
<li><code>re:\bdog\b</code> will search for the word 'dog'. It has a word boundary character (<code>\b</code>) at the
start and end, so it will match 'a dog', but not 'a doggy'.</li>
<li><code>front:re:t+1</code> would match &quot;t1&quot;, &quot;tt1&quot; and so on in the Front field</li>
<li>When searching by regex, unicode case folding is used, so searching for <code>re:über</code> will
show a card that has &quot;Über&quot; on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>nc:something</code> (short for &quot;no combining&quot;) can be used to search while
ignoring accents, eg <code>nc:uber</code> will match both &quot;über&quot; and &quot;Über&quot;. This behaves the same way as the &quot;Ignore Accents&quot; add-on, but is about 16x faster.</li>
<li>You can now sort on the deck, card template, note type and tags columns.</li>
<li>You can now use wildcards when limiting the search to a field, eg <code>field*:something</code>.</li>
<li>You can now use wildcards when searching for a card template or note type by name.</li>
<li><code>rated:x</code> searches are now capped to a year instead of a month.</li>
<li>You can now escaped double-quotes in a search - eg <code>&quot;foo\&quot;bar&quot;</code></li>
<li>Single-quote searches are no longer supported.</li>
<li>A version of Advanced Browser that works with this beta
has been made available <a href="https://github.com/ankitects/advanced-browser/releases/tag/2.1.24-fixes">here</a>. Not everything has been tested, and sorting on some fields will not currently
work properly.</li>
<li>Because the searching code has been rewritten, add-ons that modify the search code
will need to be updated to support 2.1.24. Unfortunately it is no longer possible to override the Finder class - add-ons will need to use the new hooks in the browser screen to either rewrite the search text, or perform their own lookups instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Database changes (mainly of interest to add-on developers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki now uses Rust's sqlite libraries instead of Python's.</li>
<li>The 'db' object on the collection retains most of the same API as before, minimizing the amount of immediate code changes that are required.</li>
<li>Some less-used features like named sqlite bindings (&quot;where column = :foo&quot;) and custom
sql functions are no longer supported.</li>
<li>The old database code remains in db.py, and add-ons can continue to use it for accessing
their own databases.</li>
<li>The database is now behind a mutex, and can be safely accessed from a background thread.</li>
<li>Various screens like the database check have been updated to run on a background thread,
so they no longer lock up the UI while they're running.</li>
<li>The database progress handler has been removed. Anki previous had sqlite call back into
Python periodically during long-running DB operations so it could drain the UI queue,
but this would vary in choppyness depending on the type of DB operation being performed,
and it was the cause of some crashes in the past. Add-ons that perform long-running operations
should instead use mw.taskman.run_in_background() or their own threading solution moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki will now wait for a media sync to complete or be aborted before closing the collection.</li>
<li>Fixed progress dialogs failing to appear in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Allow the type answer arrow to be styled (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>More hooks (thanks to Arthur).</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot has changed in this beta, so some issues may have slipped through the cracks. If
you run into any problems, please let me know.</p>

<p>Build 683b7983.</p>
<p>Media syncing improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media syncing now happens in the background, so you can continue using
Anki while the media sync completes.</li>
<li>Aside from syncing at open and close, Anki will sync any media changes
every 15-20 minutes.</li>
<li>You can click on the sync button while the spinner is active to monitor
progress.</li>
<li>Long filenames and problematic characters should be handled smoothly now,
instead of causing syncing errors.</li>
<li>Anki should no longer sometimes forget to download files when a media
sync fails due to network errors.</li>
<li>When media files are added within Anki, Anki now marks them
in the database immediately, which can make things faster for people with
slower disks if they are not modifying the media folder externally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Media check improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Check Media function now shows progress, and can be interrupted.</li>
<li>There is now a separate button to generate missing LaTeX.</li>
<li>If LaTeX fails to build, the problem card will be revealed in the browse
screen.</li>
<li>When Anki finds files that are too long or would cause errors on some
operating systems, it will automatically rename them and update your notes
to point to the new filename.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both media sync and the media check now place deleted files in a media.trash
folder inside your profile, instead of placing the files in the system trash.
Any files that have been sitting in that folder for a week or more will be
deleted permanently when you next run a media check.</p>

<li>You can now use <code>{{tts en_US:Field}}</code> on your card templates to use the
text to speech support built into Windows and macOS, changing the language
code as necessary.</li>
<li>You can specify the voices you'd prefer - the first available one

available here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/391644525</li>
<li>To see all available voices, use the following in the debug console:</li>
