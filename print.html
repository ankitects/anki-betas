<p>Build 43c41d76 / 2021-12-04.</p>
<p>Toolkit changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The packaged builds now come in separate Qt5 and Qt6 versions.</li>
<li>Qt6 is a recently-updated version of the toolkit. It fixes some issues that
existed in Qt5, but it may introduce new problems. We recommend you try it first.</li>
<li>Qt5 is the graphics toolkit used to build previous Anki releases. If you find
that Qt5 works for you and Qt6 does not, please let us know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or 11 is required. If you are still using Windows 7 or 8, 2.1.49 is
the last build that will install on your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is now a native build for Apple Silicon. It currently does not support
recording, and the audio playback still uses Intel binaries, so you will still
need Rosetta installed. Only Qt6 is available for Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>The Qt6 x86 build requires macOS 10.14.</li>
<li>The Qt5 x86 build requires macOS 10.13.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux builds need zstd to decompress, eg:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo apt install zstd
tar axf anki-2.1.50-linux-qt6.tar.zstd
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The x86 builds require glibc 2.27 or later.</li>
<li>A wheel is now provided for ARM64 Linux, and requires glibc 2.31 or greater. A
packaged version is not currently possible.</li>
<li>No fcitx driver or gtk2 theme is bundled with the packaged builds at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Major editor changes, mostly thanks to Henrik:</p>
<ul>
<li>A redesigned tag editor.</li>
<li>MathJax has a live preview.</li>
<li>HTML and rendered text can be viewed at the same time.</li>
<li>Images can be resized within the editor.</li>
<li>Fields can now have an optional description/tooltip assigned to them (thanks
to Matthias, Henrik &amp; Rumo).</li>
<li>Lots of behind-the-scenes changes. Because of the extensive changes, some
add-ons that modify the editing screen will have broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scheduler changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The V1 scheduler is no longer supported. If you have not yet updated to V2 or V3,
you will be prompted to update when you attempt to review cards in 2.1.50.</li>
<li>The V3 scheduler will be declared stable when 2.1.50 is released.</li>
<li>The V3 scheduler applies fuzz more evenly now, especially with smaller
intervals (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Fixed new cards not decrementing the review limit in V3, which could lead to
more new cards appearing after the review limit was reached.</li>
<li>Fixed new cards not appearing in the correct order in the V3 scheduler.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki will now switch to day or night mode automatically depending on your
system settings. You can force day or night mode in the Preferences screen.
(thanks in large part to Rumo).</li>
<li>The Card Info screen now updates automatically as you change to a different
card (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Added a shortcut to make Anki full screen (F11 or Cmd+Ctrl+F, thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Added tooltips to some browser columns (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Added an option to add/remove sidebar tag to selected notes (thanks to Rumo).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to the Change Notetype screen (thanks to Matthias).</li>
<li>Improved performance with large selections in the Browse screen (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Fixed the deck list showing up blank in collections with many expanded decks.</li>
<li>Changed the &quot;Previous Card Info&quot; shortcut to avoid a conflict with language input.</li>
<li>Possible fix for intermittent UI glitch on initial startup (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>Flip sidebar location in RTL mode (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Fix deck name not updating after deck/notetype renamed (thanks to Hikaru).</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;tag duplicates&quot; possibly operating on stale data (thanks to Ren).</li>
<li>The Add Cards screen will no longer allow accidental triggering of main window
shortcuts when it is open on a Mac (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect card count in timebox after undo (thanks to Abdo).</li>
<li>Fixed quotation of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; in search (thanks to Rumo).</li>
<li>Numerous other fixes and contributions, thanks to Rumo, Henrik, Abdo, Matthias,
Evandro, Arthur, Soren, BlueGreenMagick, Yoshi, Jakub, Gesa, blue-putty,
stopendy, and zjosua.</li>
</ul>
<p>For developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki now requires Python 3.9.</li>
<li>Anki contains some compatibility shims that should allow many add-ons written
for PyQt5 to work with PyQt6 as well (thanks to Aristotelis). These shims will
not remain forever, so it is recommended that you update your add-ons to be
compatible with Qt6 without shims. The two main breakages are the renaming of
PyQt5 to PyQt6 (you can support both by importing from aqt.qt instead), and
the requirement that <a href="https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/1406/commits/b5906305b37e2ed4767fd495a5ce74f629cb8ed1">enums are
qualified</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re using Qt Designer to generate UI files, the Qt5 and Qt6 versions
need to be generated and bundled separately if you want to support both at once.</li>
<li>PyQt6 does not support the Qt resource system (pyrcc was removed), so Anki now
uses a different approach, and urls like <code>:/icons/foo.jpg</code> should become
<code>icons:foo.jpg</code>.</li>
<li>The way Anki is packaged has changed. Most of the standard library should be
available now. If you notice any problems importing standard libraries that
previously worked, please let us know.</li>
<li>The aqt package no longer depends on PyQt, as either version 5 or 6 is supported.
You can specify the major version you want when installing - eg 'pip install aqt[qt6]'</li>
<li>manifest.json now supports a 'homepage' argument (thanks to Abdo)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Interday learning cards are included in the learning count again, instead of
the review count.</li>
<li>Interday learning cards are still affected by the review limit. Interday
learning cards are fetched first, then reviews, and finally new cards.</li>

<li>Fixed custom scheduling not working.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;timebox finished&quot; message is now shown on card answer, instead of after

<h2 id="alpha-1"><a class="header" href="#alpha-1">Alpha 1</a></h2>
<p>Build 10bfb95f / 2021-05-17.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of under-the-hood changes in this release, and there may
be some rough edges at the moment.</p>
<p>Undo handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most actions now support multiple undo steps. You can change a card template,
delete some notes, bury a card, then undo each of those steps if you wish.</li>
<li>Actions that support multiple undo steps will now save the changes
immediately, meaning that if Anki crashes, the changes you made in the last
few minutes will no longer be lost.</li>
<li>Actions that don't support the new undo handling (eg, Check Database), will
clear the undo history.</li>
<li>Add-ons will clear the undo history if they modify the database directly, or
use routines that don't support undoing. There are some new routines available
to add-ons to make operations undoable, but add-ons may need to be updated
to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scheduling changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="./2021-scheduler.html">experimental new scheduler</a>.</li>
<li>The deck list now shows the learning count separately.</li>
<li>On new collections, the v2 scheduler is now the default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Browser changes, thanks to Rumo:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sidebar now has two modes. The default allows clicking on items to search
for them. The other mode allows you to select multiple items at once, so you
can drag &amp; drop or delete multiple items.</li>
<li>The browse screen can now be toggled between showing cards,
and showing notes.</li>
<li>When showing notes, some columns will show an aggregate over all the
cards of a note.</li>
<li>Added an introduced:x search to locate cards first studied in the last x days.</li>
<li>Column rendering has been moved into the backend, and will be faster than
before (but is still limited by the speed of the graphics toolkit).</li>
<li>A fair bit of the browser code has been changed, and some add-ons like the
&quot;Advanced Browser&quot; add-on will need to be updated to support the new approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Editor changes, thanks to Henrik:</p>
<ul>
<li>The editing toolbar has been reimplemented in a way that will allow easier
improvements in the future.</li>
<li>The toolbar's icons and style have been updated.</li>
<li>The editor now provides bullet and numbered list buttons.</li>
<li>The editor now provides buttons to control text alignment and indent.</li>
<li>Sticky fields can now be toggled on/off from the editing screen.</li>
<li>Editor shortcuts are handled differently, and the current approach does not
work well on non-QWERTY keymaps. This will likely change before a stable release.</li>
<li>A new API is available for add-ons, but this has not been finalized yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>State handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make changes, the user interface should update more consistently now.
Adding a new tag to a note will update the sidebar in the Browse screen for
example, and when you review a card that is shown there, the columns will
update.</li>
<li>The Browse screen no longer refreshes a search automatically. When you make a
change, the column text may update, but the number of rows will not change.
Deleted cards show &quot;(deleted)&quot; until you search again.</li>
<li>The main window no longer shows a &quot;waiting for editing to finish&quot; screen. When
you make changes such as editing a note, the main window will dim, and will
automatically refresh when you return to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deck options screen has been reimplemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Re)learning steps are now shown with units, eg 10m or 4d.</li>
<li>Deck options are now shown on one scrollable page.</li>
<li>Extra help is available for most options.</li>
<li>It is easy to see at a glance which options have been changed from the
default, and individual options can be reverted to the default setting.</li>
<li>Warnings will be shown for some common issues (eg, review limit too low
compared to new cards).</li>
<li>Some of the more advanced options have been moved to a separate &quot;Advanced&quot;
section.</li>
<li>The old options can be accessed with a Shift+click, since it will take a while
for add-ons to be updated to support the new screen.</li>
<li>The deck description is now accessible via a button in the overview screen,
instead of via the deck options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerous behind-the-scenes improvements from Henrik and Rumo.</li>
<li>The Find&amp;Replace option in the Browse screen can now be used on tags as well.</li>
<li>You can now choose which add-ons you want to update (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).</li>
<li>Fix text with single quote not being escaped in export (thanks to Ryan).</li>
<li>Other fixes and improvements thanks to Abdo, Glutanimate, Arthur and Shaun.</li>
<li>The Card Info screen ignores manual rescheduling when calculating the average
time.</li>
<li>Performance improvements and other miscellaneous fixes.</li>

<p>Scheduler updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The V1-&gt;V2 upgrade process no longer resets cards that are in learning, or
removes cards from filtered decks.</li>
<li>Users on the old scheduler will now see a message at the top of the deck
list prompting them to update to the Anki 2.1 scheduler.</li>

experience, but that needs to wait until AnkiDroid 2.15 is released as stable,
with support for the newer timezone handling.</li>

<p>Build e0550b60 / 2020-11-12.</p>
<p>The way Anki is built and packaged has been reworked for this release, which

<p>As part of these changes, the alternate Windows and Mac builds have been
discontinued. If you're still using a 32-bit OS or a macOS version below 10.13,
2.1.35 is the last version that will work on your setup.</p>
<p>For developers, please see
https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/changing-ankis-build-system-to-bazel/4737. Python
3.8 is now the minimum supported version, so feel free to go wild with the
walrus operator.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-2135beta1"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2135beta1">Changes in 2.1.35beta1</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to
an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck
configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those
deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. If you have deliberately
set an initial ease of 130%, please change it to 131% or greater prior to
upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings alone. Users who updated from
an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not
be affected. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.</li>
<li>Roll back most of the non-bugfix scheduling changes from the previous beta, so
that this can be released as stable after a couple of days of testing.</li>

<p>Build 97eadb78.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance improvements to:</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Card generation changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Card generation now supports negated conditionals, and a mix of required
and optional fields.</li>
<li>When adding/importing, if a normal note doesn't generate any cards, Anki
will now add a blank card 1 instead of refusing to add the note.</li>

use the Empty Cards feature.</li>
<li>Cloze numbers over 499 are no longer supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Card template screen:</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="changes-in-2124beta6"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2124beta6">Changes in 2.1.24beta6</a></h3>
<p>Build 394f7c63.</p>
<p>This beta changes the macOS dark mode handling of the standard build:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anki now solely relies on the night mode setting in the preferences to decide
whether to show in light or dark mode. Some users wanted to run Anki in light
mode while keeping the rest of their system dark, and there were various
display problems when dark mode was changed after Anki started that couldn't
be easily worked around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users who only use dark mode, and preferred the native look of widgets in dark
mode, can achieve the previous appearance by running the following command in
the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool no
</code></pre>
<p>And the following in the debug console:</p>
<pre><code>mw.pm.meta[&quot;dark_mode_widgets&quot;] = True
</code></pre>
<p>This is hidden behind a debug console command because it requires the
user ensure their system is always set to the same light/dark mode
as Anki.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The macOS standard build is built with a newer SDK. If you notice any regressions, please let me know.</li>
<li>Fixed Anki closing after a full sync on collection load.</li>
<li>Fixed an error being shown when replaying audio.</li>
<li>Fixed filtered decks displaying an error in older Anki versions after downgrading.</li>
<li>Fixed add-ons with multiple branches not updating properly.</li>
<li>Change the way cloze deletions in RTL fields are handled, which should address some corner cases.</li>
<li>Fix editor buttons not being highlighted (thanks to Simone).</li>
<li>Improve invalid HTML/JS error messages (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>Fixed a useless log file being created when exporting.</li>
<li>Allow selecting add-on config help text (thanks to ijgnd).</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-2124beta1"><a class="header" href="#changes-in-2124beta1">Changes in 2.1.24beta1</a></h3>
<p>Build 9dda5cf6.</p>
<p>2.1.24 focuses on changes to the database layer and searching code.</p>
<p>Searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now use <code>re:something</code> to search via regular expression, eg:
<ul>
<li><code>re:\bdog\b</code> will search for the word 'dog'. It has a word boundary character (<code>\b</code>) at the
start and end, so it will match 'a dog', but not 'a doggy'.</li>
<li><code>front:re:t+1</code> would match &quot;t1&quot;, &quot;tt1&quot; and so on in the Front field</li>
<li>When searching by regex, unicode case folding is used, so searching for <code>re:über</code> will
show a card that has &quot;Über&quot; on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>nc:something</code> (short for &quot;no combining&quot;) can be used to search while
ignoring accents, eg <code>nc:uber</code> will match both &quot;über&quot; and &quot;Über&quot;. This behaves the same way as the &quot;Ignore Accents&quot; add-on, but is about 16x faster.</li>
<li>You can now sort on the deck, card template, note type and tags columns.</li>
<li>You can now use wildcards when limiting the search to a field, eg <code>field*:something</code>.</li>
<li>You can now use wildcards when searching for a card template or note type by name.</li>
<li><code>rated:x</code> searches are now capped to a year instead of a month.</li>
<li>You can now escaped double-quotes in a search - eg <code>&quot;foo\&quot;bar&quot;</code></li>
<li>Single-quote searches are no longer supported.</li>
<li>A version of Advanced Browser that works with this beta
has been made available <a href="https://github.com/ankitects/advanced-browser/releases/tag/2.1.24-fixes">here</a>. Not everything has been tested, and sorting on some fields will not currently
work properly.</li>
<li>Because the searching code has been rewritten, add-ons that modify the search code
will need to be updated to support 2.1.24. Unfortunately it is no longer possible to override the Finder class - add-ons will need to use the new hooks in the browser screen to either rewrite the search text, or perform their own lookups instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Database changes (mainly of interest to add-on developers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki now uses Rust's sqlite libraries instead of Python's.</li>
<li>The 'db' object on the collection retains most of the same API as before, minimizing the amount of immediate code changes that are required.</li>
<li>Some less-used features like named sqlite bindings (&quot;where column = :foo&quot;) and custom
sql functions are no longer supported.</li>
<li>The old database code remains in db.py, and add-ons can continue to use it for accessing
their own databases.</li>
<li>The database is now behind a mutex, and can be safely accessed from a background thread.</li>
<li>Various screens like the database check have been updated to run on a background thread,
so they no longer lock up the UI while they're running.</li>
<li>The database progress handler has been removed. Anki previous had sqlite call back into
Python periodically during long-running DB operations so it could drain the UI queue,
but this would vary in choppyness depending on the type of DB operation being performed,
and it was the cause of some crashes in the past. Add-ons that perform long-running operations
should instead use mw.taskman.run_in_background() or their own threading solution moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki will now wait for a media sync to complete or be aborted before closing the collection.</li>
<li>Fixed progress dialogs failing to appear in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Allow the type answer arrow to be styled (thanks to Evandro).</li>
<li>More hooks (thanks to Arthur).</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot has changed in this beta, so some issues may have slipped through the cracks. If
you run into any problems, please let me know.</p>

<p>Build 683b7983.</p>
<p>Media syncing improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media syncing now happens in the background, so you can continue using
Anki while the media sync completes.</li>
<li>Aside from syncing at open and close, Anki will sync any media changes
every 15-20 minutes.</li>
<li>You can click on the sync button while the spinner is active to monitor
progress.</li>
<li>Long filenames and problematic characters should be handled smoothly now,
instead of causing syncing errors.</li>
<li>Anki should no longer sometimes forget to download files when a media
sync fails due to network errors.</li>
<li>When media files are added within Anki, Anki now marks them
in the database immediately, which can make things faster for people with
slower disks if they are not modifying the media folder externally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Media check improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Check Media function now shows progress, and can be interrupted.</li>
<li>There is now a separate button to generate missing LaTeX.</li>
<li>If LaTeX fails to build, the problem card will be revealed in the browse
screen.</li>
<li>When Anki finds files that are too long or would cause errors on some
operating systems, it will automatically rename them and update your notes
to point to the new filename.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both media sync and the media check now place deleted files in a media.trash
folder inside your profile, instead of placing the files in the system trash.
